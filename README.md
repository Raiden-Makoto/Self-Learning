# Self-Learning
Collection of miscellaneous projects I completed as I learn new languages and frameworks.   
You can learn more about them by navigating to any subfolder and inspecting the `readme`.

## Skills & Frameworks & Languages 
- Basic minigame development in C++ and raylib
- Google BigQuery for data analytics and BQML for machine learning using SQL; basic data visualization using Looker Studio
- Introductory C# and backend development with C# (simple API calls)
- R for statistical analysis and simple machine learning (integration with Keras)

## Things I am Learning
- Amazon S3
- Docker and Kubernetes (starting soon hopefully)

## Bucket List
- Amazon EC2 and Lambda for Cloud Computing
- Rust for Machine Learning on Mac (integration with MLX)
